# Text-Classifier-using-CNNs
Implemented a basic text classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks with multiple window sizes and pre-trained Google word2vec embeddings

The directory with the data files (topicclass), the .py file and the .bin file must be in the same directory

Google News Word2Vec embeddings can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/edit
After downloading the zompressed file, unzip it to obtain the .bin file.
